# py-bite
PyBite is a fast-paced Python-built arcade game where players control a growing snake that must bite apples to survive and score points. With each apple consumed, the snake grows longer and the challenge intensifies. The game tests reflexes, strategy, and precision as players avoid colliding with walls or their own tail.
